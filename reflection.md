What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that they were difficult to get a handle on.  Padding pushes out the content inside any border and margins are outside of the border, the distance desired between objects.  They worked, but only in certain circumstances, when there was nothing else to override them. 


What did you learn about CSS positioning?

CSS positioning was a huge challenge.  I managed to get my elements positioned correctly on my index, but was unable to move the main element in my blog index, despite trying many options.  There are rules governing CSS and what takes priority in all of the hundreds of options, but without knowing those, I felt thrown to the wind.  



What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Font changes were relatively easy, as were color changes.  Almost everything else had challenges, big or small. Positioning was my bete noir.  Creating my buttons was also a challenge, but I managed it.  What was particularly confusing was when a small change in one area affected another area drastically.  I ended up doing my own version control by keeping a copy of the latest working CSS code separate, in case I broke something. 



What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I only added one image.  I still had to experiment around to find the right way to affect it.  Finally, margins did the trick.


Note:  I worked for seven hours on this challenge and was unable to complete the formatting to my satisfaction.  I researched assiduously for ideas and help.  I did my best.
