		<h1>Ruby Cheatsheet</h1>
		<article>
			<p>
			As a notetaker, I've been trying my best to document important points for myself along 
			my Dev Bootcamp journey.  Below are a few reminders for the Ruby programming language.
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Method</p>
					<p>
					Method is a procedure that allows you to extract the common code to one place
					</p>
					<p>
					Argument is a piece or pieces of information that are sent to a method to be modified 
					or used to return a specific result. We "pass" arguments to a method 
					when we call it. 
					</p>
					<xmp>def method(argument)</xmp></li>	
					
					<li><p>Numbers</p>
					<p>
					Integers are whole numbers – 1 99, 134, -6	
					</p>	
					<p>
					Floats are decimals – 1.1, -55.9, 2,222.2	
					</p>
					</li>
					
					<li><p>Strings<p>
					<p>
					Strings are words or text, including punctuation, digits, symbols and spaces.  
					They can also be empty. They are written in quotes like below:
					</p>
					<xmp>"Hi, I'm in quotes, so I'm a string!"</xmp>
					<p>
					You can’t add a number to a string.  The number has to be changed to a string first.
					</p>
					<p>
					Use  \  in place of an apostrophe  - it\s the escape character!   \\ is same as \  
					- it escapes itself.	
					</p>
					</li>
					
					<li><p>Converting String, Integers & Floats</p>
					<p>
					.to_i - converts to integer	
					</p>
					<p>
					.to_f - converts to float	
					</p>
					<p>
					.to_s - converts to string
					</p>
					</li>
					
					<li><p>Some Operators</p>
					<p>
					+ 	adds values on either side of the operator
					</p>
					<p>
					-   subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand	
					</p>
					<p>
					*   multiplies values on either side of the operator	
					</p>
					<p>
					/   divides left hand operand by right hand operand						
					</p>
					<p>
					%   divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder.
					Called modulus
					</p>
					<p>
					**  performs exponential (power) calculation on operators	
					</p>
					<p>
					==  checks if the value of two operands are equal or not.  If yes, 
					then condition becomes true	
					</p>
					<p>
					!=  checks if the value of two operands are equal or not.  If values are 
					not equal, then condition becomes true
					</p>
					<p>
					>   checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand. 
					If yes then condition becomes true
					</p>
					<p>
					<	checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand.  
					If yes, then condition becomes true
					</p>
					<p>
					>=  checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of 
					right operand.  If yes then condition becomes true
					</p>
					<p>
					<=  checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right 
					operand.  If yes then condition becomes true
					</p>
					<p>
					<=> returns 0 if first operand equals second, 1 if first operand is greater than the 
					second and -1 if first operand is less than the second.	
					</p>
					<p>
					===  used to test equality within a when clause of a case statement.	
					</p>
					<p>
					.eql?  true if the receiver and argument have both the same type and equal values.	
					</p>
					<p>
					equal?  true if the receiver and argument have the same object id.	
					</p></li>
					
					<li><p>Returning and Outputting</p>
					<p>
					p returns the evaluated code AND print to the console
					</p>	
					<p>
					puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line
					</p>	
					<p>
					print returns nil and prints the output to the console
					</p></li>
					
					<li><p>Interpolation</p>
					<p>
					#{  }  - interpolates or embeds in string form the results of a variable or number		
					</p></li>	
					
					<li><p>Code Blocks<p>
					<p>	
					Code blocks can be written two ways.  For short blocks of one line, use:
					</p>
					<xmp>{|number1, number2| number1 + number2}</xmp>
					<p>
					For multiple lines within a block, use:	
					</p>
					<pre><xmp>
method.each do |argument|
	do something fancy here
end	
					</xmp></pre></li>
					
					<li><p>Looping</p>
					<p>
					Looping is an iterator.  It just needs a block providing syntax
					</p>		
					<p>
					While, until and for are all loops in Ruby, though for is rarely used	
					</p>
					<p>
					Another way to loop is with times.  Times is an instance method of 
					the integer class.  See the example below:  
					</p>
					<xmp>5.times</xmp></li>
					
					<li><p>Arrays</p>
					<p>
					Arrays are unordered lists of objects or empty placeholders for lists.  
					They are contained within square brackets, as in the example below:
					</p>
					<xmp>array = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]</xmp>
					<p>
					Arrays are interated over to pick up each item and do something to it, as 
					in the block below:
					</p>
					<xmp>array.each {|e| puts “The block just got handed #{e}.”}</xmp></li>
					
					<li><p>Hashes</p>
					<p>
					Hashes are lists of objects with relationships - keys and values.  They 
					are contained within curly brackets with the key always listed first 
					and value second.
					</p>
					<xmp>hash = {"cat1" => "Sylvia", "cat2" => "Paro", "cat3" => "Audrey"}</xmp>
					</li>
