<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I found it to be an enjoyable process.  We were able to offer feedback on our different wireframes, brainstorm changes, and chart a path for the html.  Both my wireframe and code were improved by my pair's input.


Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, I found wireframing a useful way to outline my ideas.  It would have been less useful to only have them in text form when trying to write the code.


What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We decided that clarity and consistency made a good wireframe.  Having a graphic or some visual element livened up the page. We also thought about what would be easier for the user experience, which is very important when drafting the wireframe.  


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned that lists cannot be in paragraphs, but have to be sectioned out in another way, like <div>.-->
