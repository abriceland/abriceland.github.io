		<h1>Web Development Revisited</h1>
		<article>
			<p>
				I started out CSS week in February with a spirit of confidence and ended it reduced to a puddle of nerves.  
				Positioning was my great downfall.  Despite hours of trying, I was unable to position the main portion
				of my blog index page correctly.  It kept showing up below the element on the left, a navigation bar. And
				because my blog pages use the same basic formatting as my blog index, all of those pages were affected
				as well
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a high achiever.  I am unused to failure in a learning environment.  The inability to achieve
				a seemingly simple task was a huge blow to my ego.  I ended up having to walk away with a broken website 
				and a fear of CSS.
			</p>
			<p>
				That fear kept me from doing as much as I wanted to my site.  Had I not been running to keep up with the 
				other work for Dev Bootcamp, I would say I avoided working on my website.  But the truth is that I focused 
				on Ruby and learning the logic of the programming languages and tried to push the embarassment my site 
				represented for me to the back of my mind. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After poking around a bit the last several weeks, this week was the first one that I really tried to 
				address my site again.  Still, in order to be able to cope, I had to have my hand held.  A bootcamp
				colleague took a look at my HTML and CSS code, tried a few things and was likewise mystified as to why 
				this area kept getting pushed down below.  Then when comparing the working index page with the broken 
				blog index page, she noticed a discrepancy - my index page used a "section" tag, whereas my blog index 
				page used a "main" tag.  
			</p>
			<p>
				She changed the "main" tag to a "section" tag and, lo and behold, that part was tranported into place next 
				to the nav bar, as I had planned 6 weeks before!  My CSS positioning wasn't the problem in the least!  In 
				an effort to use HTML5 tags, I chose "main", since I believed it to be descriptive of my section.  What 
				I didn't realize and hadn't found out onis that it either takes up the page width or must be flush left.  
			</p>
			<p>	
				My friend's discovery and other helpful advice gave me the heart I needed to put more work into my site and 
				improve its appearance and functionality and I am exceedingly grateful. Now, even though my site is far 
				from perfect, it is dramatically better than it was.  Even more importantly, I have gained the requisite 
				courage to work with HTML and CSS again without fear and trepidation, which is critical for the intense 
				weeks ahead in Dev Bootcamp.
