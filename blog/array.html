		<h1>Arrays and Hashes - Potatoes, Tomatoes</h1>
		<article>
			<p>In the bewildering world of Ruby, with codenames galore, what in the world are arrays and hashes?  Excellent question, you might say, as you nod your head sagely.
			</p>
			<p>When planning your day, there is usually more than one thing you need to do.  For instance, you need to do your job.  But often for that to happen, you have to get to your job.  And once you're finished your job, you need to return home.  Perhaps there are other tasks you need to do, like cook dinner or make your bed.  
			</p>
			<p>These everyday tasks compose a list.  In Ruby, an array is just the same type of list.  By placing items in an array, they can each be easily reached and acted upon, but without necessitating acting on them individually, which takes writing a lot of extra code and more processing time.  Believe it or not, a computer's mysterious innards do not have infinite resources and the less code and quicker processing time of that code, the better.  So arrays are a very practical way of organizing lists of information and being able to use them efficiently.
			</p>
			<code>
				my_day = ["going to work", "work", "going home", "cooking dinner"]
			</code>
			<p>Each of the items in the array automatically gets a number.  In the example above, "going to work" is assigned 0 (because computers LOVE 0 and think lists should start with it), "work" is 1, "going home" is 2 and "cooking dinner" is 3.  That way, the computer can access each item in the array by its position number.  Computers love numbers in general, not just 0.
			</p>
			<p>Now sometimes a list is more than just a simple list like for purchasing groceries - carrots, check; potatoes, check; milk, check.  They have other information associated with them.  For example, going to work might mean driving your car.  Working might entail finishing a project.  Cooking dinner could include choping the potatoes.
			</p>
			<p>Hashes are how we capture these pairs of information, so you can do something with them, which for computers means processing it somehow.  Each pair is assigned a role to play.  The first is called the key, which the second is called the value.  See the example below. 
			</p>
			<code>hash = {"going to work" => "driving car", "work" => "finish project", "cook dinner" => "chop potatoes"}
			</code>
			<p>Because hashes assign the names of key and value to each pair, they don't use position like arrays.  They access the keys instead and work with the associated values from there.
			</p>
			<p>As you can see, both arrays and hashes are useful ways of organizing information, but would be used in different applications.  You wouldn't need to use a hash for a simple shopping-style list and you wouldn't use an array for a list of your family members' names and birthdates.  They each have their own function.

<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I found it to be an enjoyable process.  We were able to offer feedback on our different wireframes, brainstorm changes, and chart a path for the html.  Both my wireframe and code were improved by my pair's input.


Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, I found wireframing a useful way to outline my ideas.  It would have been less useful to only have them in text form when trying to write the code.


What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We decided that clarity and consistency made a good wireframe.  Having a graphic or some visual element livened up the page. We also thought about what would be easier for the user experience, which is very important when drafting the wireframe.  


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned that lists cannot be in paragraphs, but have to be sectioned out in another way, like <div>.-->
