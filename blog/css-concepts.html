		<h1>CSS Awakening - Display Inline vs Inline Block?</h1>
		<article>
			<p>
			    This week I was initiated into the world of CSS - Cascading Style Sheets.  At first, I was delighted.  Break out formatting from the outline and content in an HTML file - what a brilliant concept!  The process of coding in CSS is simple, so I was unprepared for what was right around the corner.
			</p>
            <p>
                CSS is hard, very hard.  There are hundreds of possibilities for sizing and positioning things, changing how text looks, adding images, creating extra features, etc.  It isn't something for the faint of heart.  The first big issue I had was trying to place to sections right next to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried and tried to get the second section to move up.  I researched, but to no avail.  Finally, I ran across the display: inline-block value and I was saved.  
            </p>
            <p>
                As an inline-block, it moved up, not into the right place, but there was movement.  It was beside the other section at last!  What had created this magic moment?
            </p>
            <p>
                Blocks, which are another alternative in display, take up the whole width of a site.  Even if they are off to one side, nothing is allowed to sit next to them.  
            </p>
            <img src="imgs/Placeholder.html">
            <p>
                In the example above from my website, the navigation bar (which is what we use to move to different pages on a website) on the left is set as inline and not allowing the element below to be on the same line.
            </p>
            <img src="imgs/Placeholder2.html">
            <p>
                In this second example, the sections are on the same line, still separate blocks, but sharing the website sandbox.  A command called float used to be used to place elements on website, but inline-block is an upgrade - "the new black". 
            </p>
            <p>
                The actual coding is simple compared to the mess your website can become without these commands.  
            </p>
            <p>
                p {display: inline;}  compared to  p {display: inline-block}
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of the rules governing CSS, most of which are still a mystery to me, understanding inline vs. inline block won't solve all of your problems.  But it's a start.
            </p>

<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I found it to be an enjoyable process.  We were able to offer feedback on our different wireframes, brainstorm changes, and chart a path for the html.  Both my wireframe and code were improved by my pair's input.


Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, I found wireframing a useful way to outline my ideas.  It would have been less useful to only have them in text form when trying to write the code.


What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We decided that clarity and consistency made a good wireframe.  Having a graphic or some visual element livened up the page. We also thought about what would be easier for the user experience, which is very important when drafting the wireframe.  


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned that lists cannot be in paragraphs, but have to be sectioned out in another way, like <div>.-->
