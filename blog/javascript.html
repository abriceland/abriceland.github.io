			How to execute in writing a good loop in Ruby has been a big challenge for me.  Since I'm new to coding, 
			trying to get the algorithmic basics while learning how to write a new language is just plain hard.  For those
			of you initiated into the hallowed halls of coding, let me explain what loops are on this fresh spring day...
			</p>
			<p>
			Loops are a way to get a computer to do a series of things one after the other without having to retype the	
			instructions repeatedly.  A loop sets up a condition, like we set up conditions in relationships.  "While 
			take out the trash, I'll wash the dishes, but you still have to sort the recycling."  For a computer, while the 
			condition is true, it will go through the loop.  In order to have the condition change eventually when everything
			you want to be done is done, you use a counter.  Each time the computer goes through the loop, the counter goes 
			up, often by one, but it can be set in a myriad of ways.  
			</p>
			<p>
			For weeks I kept forgetting to include all of the pieces of a loop in Ruby.  First, I have to remember to 
			initiate the counter, usually looking like this:
			</p>
			<code>
			i = 0
			</code>
			<p>
			Then I have to remember to set the right condition, often looking something like this:	
			</p>
			<code>
			i < word.length	
			</code>
			<p>
			Then at the bottom of the loop, I have to remember to make the counter go up, which can look like this:	
			</p>
			<code>
			i += 1	
			</code>
			<p>
			Having these important pieces spread out is confusing and makes it harder in Ruby, in my humble opinion, to 
			see what happens when they work together.  It's like scattering the pieces of a puzzle around, instead of 
			trying to put it back together!  However, I discovered this week that in Javascript, the loop is all in one 
			tidy package, a lovely Easter egg of efficiency, enclosed in brackets.  And it's easy to remember.  I just love 
			it!  It looks like this:
			</p>
			<code>
			(i = 0; i < word.length; i++)	
			</code>
			<p>
			Is that a thing of beauty or what?  I feel a frisson of pleasure everytime I type it, because it MAKES SENSE.  
			Thank you, Javascript!
			</p>
