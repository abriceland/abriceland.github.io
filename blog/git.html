    <h2>Programming for everyone</h2>
    <h4>Feb. 15, 2016</h4>
  
    <article>
      <p>
        Welcome to my blog! Here, as I trudge through the high mountains and low valleys of 
        learning to code, I will attempt to demystify the bizare and complex world of web 
        programming. You, too, can set the world aflame with code, never fear!
      </p>
      <p>
          This weeks' initiation was into the command line interface (that tiny black box with 
          the power to control much of the world as we know it), git and GitHub. The latter 
          two will be the topics of today's blog.
      </p>
      <p>
          Code has to live somewhere and it is much better to have a safe, warm place where 
          it won't wander off and get lost, as young, naive code is prone to do. GitHub is 
          that safe place, a barricade in the form of an online repository. Git is a rank of 
          guards checking whoever visits and tries to influence the impressionable code. This 
          type of protective tool is called version control. Working code is saved as a "master"
          using the might of git on GitHub's shining repository. Branches of the master can be worked 
          on by any number of programmers locally on their own computers at the same time. Once 
          an update or addition to the code is finished, it is sent to GitHub via the all-powerful 
          black box (command line interface) using git. There, each input is saved intact as a 
          version and is compared to the master prior to merging the two files. The guards of git 
          will notice even a minute change when an update is "pushed" to GitHub and create a new 
          version accordingly.
      </p>
        <p>
        In the micro-detailed world of coding, this type of version control has crystal-clear 
        advantages. The code is always safe at home and git eyeballs any potential negative 
        influences before irreparable harm can be done. That makes it easy to protect the delicate 
        code and backtrack to a previous version, if there are any unforseen issues with changes. 
        GitHub offers the additional perk of having a large network of programmers willing to 
        check each other's code for error - for free! What better home could a little code have?
