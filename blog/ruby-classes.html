		<h1>Who Needs Classes?</h1>
		<article>
			<p>As if working many hours a week to complete the requirements in my development bootcamp 
			wasn't enough, there are also classes within Ruby, the programming language we have been 
			learning about for three weeks now.  
			</p>
			<p>
			But classes in Ruby are actually very useful.  In essence, they are more like families, 
			groups of relations all together.  They can create new family members who look and act 
			the same way.  It's an easy way to make duplicates in Ruby.
			</p>
			<p>Here's an example below:
				
			</p>
			<pre>
			class Cat_toy
		    	attr_reader :name
		    	CAT_NAME = ["Paro", "Audrey", "Sylvia"]
		
		    	def initialize(name)
		        	@name = name
		    	end
		    
		    	def playing
		        	"#{CAT_NAME.sample} is playing with the #{name}!"
		    	end
		
			end
						
			flying_bird = Cat_toy.new("Flying Bird"
						
			flying_bird.playing


			</pre>
			<p>
			The name of the class is Cat_toy and it is like a template that can be used to create different 
			copies for the many and varied cat toys available to the pampered feline.  The attr_reader 
			(attribute reader) sets instance variables.  Local variables are only valid with a method, 
			but instance variables can be share through a class, making them more flexible and bendy, 
			like a good fishing pole cat toy. 
			</p>
			<p>Because they are so flexible, I used both of the instance variables, @name and @cat_name, 
			in the method playing.  When in the attr_reader, they only have a colon (:), but the @ sign in 
			front indicates that they have a different function from a normal local variable.  The 
			constant with a method attached, #{CAT_NAME.sample}, takes one of the names in CAT_NAME 
			randomly and displays it in the sentence.  The #{name} adds in the toy name supplied when 
			the template is accessed outside of the family group of the class.  And they both work way 
			down at the bottom in the method!  That's family.  
				
			</p>
			<p>You don't always need these types of variables.  Sometimes, you just need a little variable 
			to do one job and then be forgotten.  Instance variables are a clever way to make variable 
			more widely available, while still keeping them exclusive enough to remain interesting to a 
			finicky feline.  Interestingly enough, the method playing is also considered an instance 
			method, because it too can be accessed outside of the class.  It's not as flashy as the 
			variable, but does its thing quietly and efficently, like a cat stalking its prey.
