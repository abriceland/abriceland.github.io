		<h1>Pay No Attention to the Man Behind the Curtain! - Ruby on Rails</h1>
		<article>

			<p>
			For several months, I've known I would be learning Ruby on Rails once onsite at Dev Bootcamp, but I haven't
			understood what Ruby on Rails actually is.  From my research and what I had been told by others, I knew that
			it wasn't something I should touch until I understood Ruby or I would be completely and irrevocably confused.  
			As a consequence, Ruby on Rails has always been the man behind the curtain for me - a mystery to be 
			understood when I was wiser and fully prepared for my initiation into its sacred realm.
			</p>
			<p>
			But Ruby is not an easy thing to grasp in a mere 6-week time-span without prior programming experience.  I have 
			a much greater understanding of it than my complete and total ignorance before, but am still struggling to wrap my
			mind around the specific logic and write salient, and more importantly, consistently working code without
			trial and error.  However, despite my clear lack of worthiness, I still feel moved to at least peek behind
			the curtain and see what my future has in store for me.
			</p>
			<p>
			Ruby on Rails, also referred to as Rails, is a framework that uses the Ruby language to make it easier for
			web developers to create web pages and sites.  What is a framwork, do I hear you ask?  Excellent question!  I 
			had to look up the answer myself.  It is software that takes the basics of a web page and through magical, 
			behind-the-curtain, Rubyesque code, makes it easy to do what the vast majority of developers would want to do. 
			Customized features still need to created, but the basics are already there, creating much less work for the
			developer.
			</p>
			<p>
			There are other aspects for one embarking on a Rails journey I espied - starting a web server; creating a 
			controller and a view; foreign concepts like actions, file and routes.  From my peek, it is important to get 
			Rails to say hello to you, as if it is a living being, after which there are resources and bin/rake routes
			to be grappled with.  If this description doesn't clarify things for you, don't worry.  I am still uninitiated,
			remember, and only got a swift glance.  At this point, I should be sharing code with you, but in this instance,
			I don't have any to share.  Rails is still au unfathomable mystery to me.  
			</p>
			<p>
			Soon I will be riding Ruby on Rails.  Not only is Rails a framework, but it's also a journey!  I'm not sure 
			where it will take me, but my bootcamp experience has been quite the dramatic ride thus far, so I'm sure its 
			mysteries will be challenging, exciting and scary at the same time.  If you're up for the challenge, hop on 
			and ride Rails with me!
			</p>
