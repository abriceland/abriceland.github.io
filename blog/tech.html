		<h1>Pay No Attention to the Man Behind the Curtain! - Ruby on Rails</h1>
		<article>

			<p>
			For several months, I've known I would be learning Ruby on Rails once onsite at Dev Bootcamp, but I haven't
			understood what Ruby on Rails actually is.  From my research and what I had been told by others, I knew that
			it wasn't something I should touch until I understood Ruby or I would be completely and irrevocably confused.  
			As a consequence, Ruby on Rails has always been the man behind the curtain for me - a mystery to be 
			understood when I was wiser and fully prepared for my initiation into its sacred realm.
			</p>
			<p>
			But Ruby is not an easy thing to grasp in a mere 6-week time-span without prior programming experience.  I have 
			a much greater understanding of it than my complete and total ignorance before, but am still struggling to wrap my
			mind around the specific logic and write salient, and more importantly, consistently working code without
			trial and error.  However, despite my clear lack of worthiness, I still feel moved to at least peek behind
			the curtain and see what my future has in store for me.
			</p>
			<p>
			Ruby on Rails, also referred to as Rails, is a framework that uses the Ruby language to make it easier for
			web developers to create web pages and sites.  What is a framwork, do I hear you ask?  Excellent question!  I 
			had to look up the answer myself.  It is software that takes the basics of a web page and through magical, 
			behind-the-curtain, Rubyesque code, makes it easy to do what the vast majority of developers would want to do. 
			Customized features still need to created, but the basics are already there, creating much less work for the
			developer.
			</p>
			<p>
			There are other aspects - starting a web server, creating a controller and a view, actions, file and routes.
			It is important to get Ruby to say hello to you, after which there are resources and bin/rake routes.
			If this doesn't clarify things for you, don't worry.  I am still uninitiated, remember, and only got a swift 
			peek.  At this point, I should be sharing code with you, but in this instance, I don't have any to share.  So, I 
			will instead show you an image of the Rails default information page you see when your web server is up and 
			running:

			As you can see by the sub-heading, "You're riding Ruby on Rails!"  Not only is Rails a framework, but it's 
			also a journey!  I'm not sure where it will take me, but my bootcamp experience has been quite the dramatic
			ride thus far, so I'm sure its mysteries will be challenging, exciting and scary at the same time.  If you're 
			up for the challenge, hop on and ride Rails with me!
