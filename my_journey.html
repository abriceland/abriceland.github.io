		<h1>My Journey</h1>
		<h1>Alicia Briceland</h1>
		<article>
			<p>
			I'm originally from Richmond, Virginia.  I enjoy writing, cherry blossoms, animals and have Bachelors and Masters in Music.  I am a huge Anglophile and love spending time watching British TV shows. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I came to programming the long way round.   As the child of history professors, I was steered towards law as a profession.  But my passion was singing, so I chose to major in music and train to become an opera singer.
			</p>
			<p>
			The world of the arts of one of privation.  It can take many years to be ready for a performance career.  In the meantime, life doesn't stop.  Rent still needs to be paid.  I took day jobs in companies in whatever role I could get that would let me leave at 5 pm - not always easy in our society of overachievers.  But my priority was to be able to sing at night, so I took boring, low-level jobs as a result.
			</p>			
			<p>
			I dreamed about a more challenging job that would have some flexibility while paying better and giving me more security.  But two degrees in music aren't worth the paper they are written on outside of the arts world.   I considered becoming a developer over 10 years ago. But that would have entailed getting another degree and the current zeitgeist was that programming jobs would be outsourced.  No one forsaw the Internet Revolution.
			</p>			
			<p>
			After too many years being bored every day by my job, I decided to teach voice lessons full-time.  I had done some teaching on the weekends since grad school, but wanted to immerse myself in my passion for singing by helping others who were struggling.  Little did I know that having a successful teaching studio is less about being a great teacher than being able to market yourself.  
			</p>
			<p>
			So, here I am, a few years later.  I'm still looking for the ideal job to provide a stable income, so I can pursue singing and teaching without starving in an attic.  Developing is just that career for me.  It is challenging and creative, yet offers flexibility.  I love working in pairs and solving a problem.  I know I can be a successful programmer, if I can just make it through Dev Bootcamp!
